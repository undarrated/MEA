            <h1>UI/UX Case Study: Online Learning Platform</h1>
            <p>In this article, I will guide you through my design process for Made Easy Academia, 
                an online learning platform designed to empower Nigerian students with access to 
                high-quality education. This case study will explore the challenges, design 
                decisions, and iterative development process that led to the creation of a
